"""Exact fleet-plan solver: how many learner islands of each shape to run.

Chooses integer counts x_c >= 0 per candidate island shape so as to
lexicographically maximize total effective TFLOPs, then minimize total $/hr
among FLOPs-optimal plans, subject to a $/hr budget (which must also cover a
fixed head-VM cost), per-quota-bucket vCPU caps, and a fleet-wide island cap.

WHY branch-and-bound instead of pulp/CBC: instances are tiny (tens of
candidates, at most ~16 islands), so exact search with two admissible upper
bounds solves them in microseconds and keeps yeto dependency-free.  The
lexicographic objective is also awkward to encode as a single MILP objective
without fragile big-M weights.  Everything here is deterministic: candidate
order, branching order, and tie-breaks are all fixed, so the same inputs
always produce the same plan.
