"""Orchestrate a shape plan: gather signals in parallel, filter, solve, render.

The expensive part is talking to AWS (quota limits + current usage, spot
placement scores) and the HF Hub (weight sizes). Everything goes through a
shared TTL disk cache, and the AWS signal families are fetched concurrently —
each provider also fans out internally — so a cold run is one network wave
and a warm run is zero network.

Two honesty rules shape the output: catalog spot prices are estimates (they
move), so the budget is enforced against margin-inflated prices; and a plan
that stacks several islands of one shape in one region is re-checked against
the placement score at the *aggregate* capacity, since obtainability decays
with size.
